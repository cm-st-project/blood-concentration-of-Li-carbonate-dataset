# Patient Data with Lithium Concentration Levels

## Description
This dataset contains information on 236 patients, including various clinical and demographic variables. The dataset is designed for use in training machine learning models to predict lithium concentration levels based on patient data.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is provided as a CSV file (`patients_data.csv`) with the following columns:

- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Daily_Dose**: Daily dose of medication (in mg). Lithium doses typically range from 300 to 900 mg per day, but higher doses (up to 1200 mg/day) are sometimes prescribed.
- **Age**: Age of the patient (in years). Patients' ages can realistically range from 18 to 65 years old.
- **ALT**: Alanine aminotransferase levels (in U/L). Normal range is typically 7-56.
- **AST**: Aspartate aminotransferase levels (in U/L). Normal range is typically 10-40.
- **ALB**: Albumin levels (in g/dL). Normal range is typically 3.5-5.0.
- **TBIL**: Total bilirubin levels (in mg/dL). Normal range is typically 0.1-1.2.
- **Cr**: Creatinine levels (in Âµmol/L). Normal range for creatinine is typically 60-110 for women and 70-120 for men.
- **Zopiclone**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Zopiclone is co-administered.
- **Quinine**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Quinine is co-administered.
- **Tipine**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Tipine is co-administered.
- **Lorazepam**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Lorazepam is co-administered.
- **Olanzapine**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Olanzapine is co-administered.
- **Valproate**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Valproate is co-administered.
- **Metoprolol**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Metoprolol is co-administered.
- **Statins**: Binary indicator (0 or 1) if Statins are co-administered.
- **Li_Concentration**: Lithium concentration levels (in mmol/L). Therapeutic range for lithium is typically 0.6-1.2 mmol/L.


## Data Summary
- **Number of Entries**: 236
- **Lithium Concentration Range**: 0.6 to 2.0 mmol/L
- **Higher-than-Typical Lithium Concentrations**: Approximately 20% of the entries have lithium concentrations above the typical therapeutic range (1.2 to 2.0 mmol/L).

## Usage
This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, including but not limited to:
- Predicting lithium concentration levels based on patient clinical and demographic data.
- Studying the relationship between lithium concentration and various clinical variables.
- Evaluating the performance of regression models in predicting lithium levels.
